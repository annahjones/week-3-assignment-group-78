Prompt:
Identify potential biases in your MNIST or Amazon Reviews model. How could tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or spaCy’s rule-based systems mitigate these biases?

Response:
1. Bias in the MNIST Model (TensorFlow CNN)
Potential Bias:
MNIST is a relatively clean and balanced dataset, but it has limitations:

It consists only of handwritten digits from Western-style numerals.

It lacks diversity in handwriting styles (age, nationality, or device-specific styles).

It does not represent low-resolution or real-world handwriting use cases (e.g., from mobile images).

Mitigation Strategy:

Use TensorFlow Fairness Indicators to monitor performance across subgroups (if metadata such as writer age/gender were available).

Augment the training data with diverse digit styles or use datasets like EMNIST or Devanagari digits for broader coverage.

Perform adversarial testing on edge cases such as rotated digits or light blur.

2. Bias in the Amazon Reviews NER + Sentiment Model (spaCy + Rule-Based)
Potential Bias:

Rule-based sentiment classifiers rely heavily on pre-defined word lists, which may miss nuances.

Some terms can have ambiguous sentiment based on context (e.g., “cheap” can be positive or negative).

The NER component may fail to recognize new or localized brand names due to limited pretraining data.

Mitigation Strategy:

Extend rule-based approaches with custom sentiment models trained on labeled datasets from specific product domains.

Use spaCy's EntityRuler to enhance detection of underrepresented brands.

Continuously evaluate results across different product types, languages, and user demographics.
